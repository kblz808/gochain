we secure our blockchain by forcing the network to do work (computational power) to add a block to the chain

miners just do this proof of work so that they can sign sign the blocks on the blockchain

why do they get fees?, bcs they are powering the actual network by running the proof of work algo

the work is hard but prooving the work is an easy task
